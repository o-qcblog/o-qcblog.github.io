As long as a branch of science offers an abundance of problems, so long it is alive; 
a lack of problems foreshadows extinction or the cessation of independent development.                                                   
                                                        - DavidHilbert, 1900
                                                        
I am a curious learner exploring the interface of Computer Science, Physics and Mathematics. Teaching or communicating ideas is the best way of learning. As I unravel and learn new things in the domain of quantum computing, quantum algorithms and, complexity theory and also its classical counterparts, I will pen down my learnings and make a repository for myself and other fellow learners. 

Happy reading!
