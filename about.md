Hi! I am Padmapriya, an undergraduate physics student with a keen interest in theoretical computer science. As a curious learner, I love exploring the intersection of computer science, mathematics, and physics. I believe teaching and communicating ideas are the best ways to learn. As I delve into algorithms, complexity theory, quantum computing, and other exciting topics in theoretical computer science, I'll document my learnings here. This blog will serve as a repository for myself and fellow learners.

Happy reading!
