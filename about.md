Hi! I am Padmapriya. I am a curious learner exploring the interface of computer science, mathematics and physics. Teaching or communicating ideas is the best way of learning. As I unravel and learn new things in the domain of algorithms, complexity theory, quantum computing and many more exciting topics in theoritical computer science, I will pen down my learnings and make a repository for myself and other fellow learners. 

Happy reading!
