title: Pebbling a Checkerboard
---

After a long day of work, you and your friend go to a cafe. There is a checkerboard on the cafe table. Some pebbles lie around to enhance the ambience. Seeing this, your friend challenges you with a task. She is willing to bear a huge chunk of the bill depending on how well you complete the task. You, who love taking up challenges, readily agree. 

The checkerboard is of dimension $4 \times n$, and there are $2n$ pebbles at your disposal. Your friend writes an arbitrary integer on each square of the checkerboard. She challenges you to place these pebbles, one on each square, but on the condition that no two pebbles can be on horizontally or vertically adjacent squares (diagonal adjacency is fine). She is willing to pay a bill equivalent to the sum of integers written on the squares you tailed using these pebbles. 

You realise that the $n$ is too big. You are very hungry and can not afford to solve the puzzle slower than running a linear time algorithm to solve it. How can you write a clever algorithm and make a hearty meal?
